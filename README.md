# DungeonCrawlUnity
A short experiment to assess the viability of writting an RPG game in Unity

# The WHY
This started out as a challenge to help us understand complex relations between objects.

# The WHAT
The project as it was given to us was a 2D game. We, my team ans I, thought it would be much better to do it 3D.

# The HOW
Unity! That's how! It is a game engine that allows placing assets on a map and defining their behaviour via C# scripting.
And that's what we did. We came up with a story, sought out relevant assets, scripted them and placed them on the map

# The WHO
This experiment was coded by a team of three - myself, Sergiu Pert and Aleca Dumitru.

# The GAME
The game takes place in 3 stages (maps) and allows the players to fight their way through various enemies,
while collecting items and searching for the door to open the next level. Enemies increase in strength but players levelup as well.
Melee and ranged weapon are available, along with magic to allow players to find their way out through the hoards of enemies.
The game is only over once the last boss is defeated, though, and that is a bit of a challenge.
